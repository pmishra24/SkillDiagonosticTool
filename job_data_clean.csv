Why Join WEI?
End-to-End Involvement
 Our engineers don’t just hand off designs; they follow through from feasibility to implementation and keep tabs on long-term performance.
Diverse Project Portfolio
 You’ll gain exposure to various sectors—industrial, commercial, medical, food industry, and more—so you won’t be stuck in a single specialty.
Team-Oriented Culture
 We value collaboration, open dialogue, and professional growth. You’ll work side-by-side with managers and senior engineers who want you to succeed.
Meaningful Impact
 Our projects help clients save money, reduce carbon footprints, and sometimes eliminate entire utility systems. Your work will make a tangible difference.

The State Land Board is a state agency with a constitutional mandate to generate reasonable and consistent income over time for state trust beneficiaries—K-12 education and other public institutions—while protecting and enhancing the long term value and productivity of trust land, mineral, water, and commercial assets through the application of sound stewardship practices. SLB is the second largest landowner in the state, managing a $4.5 billion endowment of trust assets that includes three million surface acres of working lands (about 4.5% of Colorado’s land area) and four million sub-surface mineral acres. Surface lands are currently leased for agriculture, grazing, recreation, commercial real estate, rights-of-way, ecosystems services, and renewable energy. Subsurface minerals are leased for oil and gas, and mining of hardrock, sand and gravel. Leasing is now expanding into geologic carbon storage and geothermal energy generation.
The Public School Trust is the largest of the nine intergenerational public trusts managed by the State Land Board and accounts for almost 99 percent of total annual trust revenues. Over the past decade, the Land Board has experienced tremendous revenue growth, generating more than $265 million in operating revenues in FY24. These revenues support the Colorado Department of Education’s Building Excellent Schools Today (BEST) program, the Public School Permanent Fund (Permanent Fund), and State Land Board operations.

Product Supply Manager,Harry's Inc.,"New York, NY",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/product-supply-manager-at-harry-s-inc-4157999102,"About Harry's Inc
Harry's Inc. is building a modern CPG company by putting people first and delivering against real unmet consumer needs.
The company's flagship brand - Harry's - was founded by Jeff Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield in 2013. After successfully launching and scaling Harry's, Jeff and Andy saw an opportunity to bring their experience building Harry's to other CPG categories where the consumer has also been historically underserved.
Harry's Inc. has grown significantly over the last ten years, and is now made up of four brands - Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, Mando - and Harry's Labs, the company's incubation and M&A engine. The company employs more than 900 people across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and is the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years.
Lume is a 4-year-old fast growing eCommerce deodorant and personal care brand that's transforming the way that humans do hygiene. We recently joined forces with Harry's, another disruptive brand with great people and infrastructure, to accelerate our growth. We are a team of self-starters that roll up our sleeves and get it done. Our style is collaborative, and very fast-paced so an adaptive personality is a must.
We are looking for a Supply Chain Manager to join our team! 
The Supply Chain team at Lume works with both external contract manufacturers and cross functional partners (Fulfillment, R&D, Marketing, Analytics teams + more) to develop production plans, optimize inventory and ensure high customer fulfillment rates. Additionally, the team is responsible for the end-to-end supply chain, including product development, supplier relationships and inbound freight to our fulfillment centers. The Supply Chain Manager will own development of a time based supply plan and inventory strategy for multiple product categories at Lume. They will become the primary point of contact for these categories, both to internal cross-functional partners and external suppliers.
Responsibilities: 
Closely collaborate with a global network of suppliers, with a focus on long-term relationship building, capacity planning, and timeliness.
While always keeping Lume's vision in perspective, leverage your supplier relationships to secure capacity, lead times, and innovation to deliver value to our customers.
Model scenarios and understand impacts of changes to demand, supply and network assumptions. 
Partner with the team to iterate and implement new processes by identifying process inefficiencies and making recommendations for continuous improvement.
Communicate effectively with suppliers on all production and supply needs including but not limited to issuing purchase orders, managing short term and long term timelines, and future capacity needs. 
Optimize service and inventory levels by SKU at each location of the supply chain network (plant, co-packer, in transit, DC).
This should describe you
5+ years of experience working in operations
2-3 years of experience in supply and inventory planning, ideally in a CPG environment.
Strong analytical and quantitative skills with ability to develop inventory models to support a complex supply network.
Strong communicator. Ability to communicate well with various cross-functional teams and individual contributors, as well as your suppliers. Ability to cater to your audience, whether with peers, leadership, supplier senior leaders, plant workers, etc.
You want the skus you manage to thrive! You are enthusiastic and committed at every stage of a product life-cycle from cradle to grave.
Though you are comfortable working with virtual teams (Lume is 100% remote), you don't mind traveling directly to the source of your suppliers (1 or 2 days per month) to ensure that we are in the most capable hands and are always achieving our supply objectives. 
Experience with ERPs. SAP is a plus
Sense of urgency: bias for taking action. Self-starting capability required to achieve high expectations in a fast-paced environment
Attention to detail. You are comfortable going deep into the weeds while always considering the bigger picture
You are a learner - always seeking to improve yourself, your team, and the world around you
You are extremely organized, attentive to detail, and adept at working within deadlines
Sense of humor -- we take our work seriously and ourselves un-seriously

The Department of City Planning (DCP) plans for the strategic growth and development of the city through ground-up planning with communities, the development of land use policies and zoning regulations applicable citywide and sharing its perspectives on growth and community needs with sister agencies in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
The New York City Department of City Planning is a great place to work – cultivating intellectual inspiration, professional development and creativity. Visit our website at www.nyc.gov/planning to access the full listing of job opportunities and to learn more about our great agency.
THE DIVISION
The Climate and Sustainability Planning (CSP) team at DCP helps prepare the city for a changing climate and advances initiatives to protect and enhance New York City’s waterfront. Our work promotes an active, accessible and resilient waterfront, and climate ready, carbon neutral, and environmentally sustainable buildings, neighborhoods, and residents. Our work involves planning, project review, and policy development in partnership with city, state, and federal agencies, neighborhood residents, and numerous stakeholders.

THE ROLE
New York City’s waterfront is a tremendous asset to the city and one that has the potential to provide recreational and economic opportunities and increase the city's resiliency to climate change and sea level rise. CSP is launching a two-year-long study of waterfront public access requirements in the Zoning Resolution, which have been in place for over 30 years. These regulations mean that many forms of development on the waterfront are required to provide publicly accessible open space to and along the shoreline as a condition of development. The study will assess what is working well and where there is room to improve these regulations to shape the next generation of waterfront open space.
The study is part of City of Yes for Families, a muti-pronged initiative also announced in the 2025 State of the City to help families live and thrive across the boroughs, including by promoting equitable access to public spaces. The study's goals are to foster resiliency strategies and an inviting public realm, promote efficiency and transparency in the processes by which waterfront public access areas are reviewed and constructed, and identify opportunities to expand access to communities that currently cannot access the waterfront.
The Study Will Be Conducted In Partnership With DCP’s Urban Design Division. The Selected Candidate Will Work Closely With An Urban Designer To Complete Shared Tasks And Deliverables. The Selected Candidate Will Perform Individual And Collaborative Work Including – But Not Limited To – The Following

Develop KPIs and business cases to measure adoption, security effectiveness, and product success.
Support sales and marketing teams with technical expertise, technical messaging, and competitive positioning.

Director - Solutions Consulting,Pano AI,"San Francisco, CA",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/director-solutions-consulting-at-pano-ai-4151026181,"Who we are
The problem:
 Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.
About Pano: 
 Pano is a venture-backed early-stage climate tech startup that is the leader in wildfire early detection, leveraging the latest advancements in IoT, AI, satellites, and SaaS software to deliver actionable intelligence to customers. Pano leverages mountaintop cameras and satellites to detect the first traces of smoke and put real-time fire images in the hands of asset owners and first responders to speed up containment. Pano is already partnering with major utilities, fire authorities, and government agencies in the USA and Australia. Recent media coverage includes being named one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023 by FastCompany and recipient of the Innovative Mobile Service and Application Award at Mobile World Congress through our partnership with T-Mobile.
Pano brings together a diverse team bridging frontline, wildland firefighting experience with best-in-class know-how in operations, logistics, artificial intelligence, and software. Our team is composed of experienced technology professionals from companies such as Apple, Cisco, Nest, DoorDash and Meta.
